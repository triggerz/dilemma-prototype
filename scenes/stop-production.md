# Description

In a routine inspection of a large production badge you find an trace that could indicate a larger quality problem - but could also be completely harmless. 

You know that if the problem is confirmed it would mean that the full badge would need to be destructed, and that the problem very well could be the same for the next badge, currently being produced. 

It will take you 2 hours to reach certainty about the problem - and by then the current badge will be produced. 

What do you do? 


# Choice
Appreciative: Stop the production immediately.

# Variables
 - Resources: -1
 - Engagement: -1
 - Output: -5
 - Total: round(((Engagement * Output) / 100) - (100 - Resources))

# Feedback
It's good that you take even potential problems very seriously. But stopping production is a very serious move and should only happen if you have confirmed the reality of the problem OR if you get a supporting opinion from either your direct manager or a peer. 

In this case it would take 2 hours to confirm, so the right action would be to reach out to your direct manager or - if not available - get a confirming opinion from a peer before stopping production.  

# Outcome
You experienced a negative effect in output (-5) and a sligt losss in engagement as you did not involve anyone else (-1). This dilemma was estimated for use of -1 resource, which is what you used in this case.

# Choice
Contact your direct manager and ask for advice

# Variables
 - Resources: -1
 - Engagement: -2
 - Output: +3
 - Total: round(((Engagement * Output) / 100) - (100 - Resources))

# Feedback
You probably picked this conversation style, because you wanted to give John a chance to explain the situation from his perspective. And it a good skill to listen to your employees. 

But it could also lead to a discussion and as you already made your decision, this conversation style might be an uneasy choice. You need to explain what decision you made and why.

The best choice here is appreciate John's strengths first, to make certain that the discussion is not only about his challenges. This increases the chance that he is not in a defensive position, but is willing to cooperate. 

Great that you didn't choose to let your HR Partner handle the conversation. You are taking responsibility for your decision. 

Also good that you didn't choose to keep an open mind - you have already checked with employees - and another round may probably not change a lot in the conclusion. It will just waste time and take the atmosphere in the team from bad to worse.


# Outcome
You experienced a positive effect in output (+3), but John was not happy with your decision and his engagement decreased (-2). This dilemma was estimated for use of -1 resource, which is what you used in this case (-1).

# Choice
Ask a peer for support before you stop production.

# Variables
 - Resources: -3
 - Engagement: -3
 - Output: +3
 - Total: round(((Engagement * Output) / 100) - (100 - Resources))

# Feedback
You chose letting your HR Partner handling the conversation with John about relocation. Maybe you chose this solution, because you are trying to avoid a potential conflict? 

Your HR Partner is definitely a resource you can use in this situation as support or preparing yourself for the conversation. But you need to take responsibility for your decision. 

The best choice here is appreciate John's strengths first, to make certain that the discussion is not only about his challenges. This increases the chance that he is not in the defensive position, but is willing to cooperate. 

You could also have started the conversation by letting John explain first, but this could have led to a discussion and making it difficult explain why you have decided to move John. 

But good that you didn't choose to keep an open mind - you have already checked with employees - and another round may probably not change a lot in the conclusion. It will just waste time and take the atmosphere in the team from bad to worse.


# Outcome
You experienced a positive effect in output (+3), but John was highly demotivated, (-3). This dilemma was estimated for use of -1 resource, but since you involved HR you tripled the use of resources used in this case (-3 )
