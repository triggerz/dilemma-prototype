# Description

For the last couple of weeks you have been experiencing some bad vibes in your team, with people snapping at each other.  

You have been asking around, and your employees confirm your suspicion. It seems to be narrowing down to chemistry issues between Cathrin and John. 

Individually they both function well. But when they are on the same shift the atmosphere becomes intolerable. 

You have had individual talks with both John and Cathrin. After a thorough analysis of the options, the conclusion is clear: You need to relocate John to another team.

How will you handle the conversation with John?

# Choice
Appreciative: You start by complimenting John's work in the team. And then you explain why John need to be relocated. 

# Variables
 - Resources: -1
 - Engagement: -1
 - Output: +3
 - Total: round(((Engagement * Output) / 100) - (100 - Resources))

# Feedback
You probably picked this conversation style, because this showed John that you not only see his problems but also his strengths. 

It increased the chance that he did not go into a defensive position, but was willing to cooperate. This gave you the chance to explain your decision in clear and precise terms.

That was great choice. John understood the situation and felt quite relieved that you found a solution. 
You could also have started the conversation by letting John explain first, but this would have led to a discussion, making it difficult explain why you had decided to move John. 

Great that you didn't choose to let your HR Partner handle the conversation. You are taking responsibility for your decision. 

Also good that you didn't choose to keep an open mind - you have already checked with employees - and another round will probably not change a lot in the conclusion. It will just waste time and take the atmosphere in the team from bad to worse.

# Outcome
You experienced a positive effect in output (+3), since John was relieved with your decision, his engagement only decreased a bit (-1). This dilemma was estimated for use of -1 resource, which is what you used in this case.

# Choice
Letting John explain first: You start by asking John to explain the situation from his perspective, but end by explaining that John need to be relocated. 

# Variables
 - Resources: -1
 - Engagement: -2
 - Output: +3
 - Total: round(((Engagement * Output) / 100) - (100 - Resources))

# Feedback
You probably picked this conversation style, because you wanted to give John a chance to explain the situation from his perspective. And it a good skill to listen to your employees. 

But it could also lead to a discussion and as you already made your decision, this conversation style might be an uneasy choice. You need to explain what decision you made and why.

The best choice here is appreciate John's strengths first, to make certain that the discussion is not only about his challenges. This increases the chance that he is not in a defensive position, but is willing to cooperate. 

Great that you didn't choose to let your HR Partner handle the conversation. You are taking responsibility for your decision. 

Also good that you didn't choose to keep an open mind - you have already checked with employees - and another round may probably not change a lot in the conclusion. It will just waste time and take the atmosphere in the team from bad to worse.


# Outcome
You experienced a positive effect in output (+3), but John was not happy with your decision and his engagement decreased (-2). This dilemma was estimated for use of -1 resource, which is what you used in this case (-1).

# Choice
Ask HR for help: Ask your HR Partner to inform John about his relocation.

# Variables
 - Resources: -3
 - Engagement: -3
 - Output: +3
 - Total: round(((Engagement * Output) / 100) - (100 - Resources))

# Feedback
You chose letting your HR Partner handling the conversation with John about relocation. Maybe you chose this solution, because you are trying to avoid a potential conflict? 

Your HR Partner is definitely a resource you can use in this situation as support or preparing yourself for the conversation. But you need to take responsibility for your decision. 

The best choice here is appreciate John's strengths first, to make certain that the discussion is not only about his challenges. This increases the chance that he is not in the defensive position, but is willing to cooperate. 

You could also have started the conversation by letting John explain first, but this could have led to a discussion and making it difficult explain why you have decided to move John. 

But good that you didn't choose to keep an open mind - you have already checked with employees - and another round may probably not change a lot in the conclusion. It will just waste time and take the atmosphere in the team from bad to worse.


# Outcome
You experienced a positive effect in output (+3), but John was highly demotivated, (-3). This dilemma was estimated for use of -1 resource, but since you involved HR you tripled the use of resources used in this case (-3 )

# Choice
Keep an open mind: You take an open talk with John (you might have missed something in your analysisâ€¦) 

# Variables
 - Resources: +0
 - Engagement: -3
 - Output: -3
 - Total: round(((Engagement * Output) / 100) - (100 - Resources))

# Feedback
You chose to check again. Maybe you are afraid that analysis is not substantial enough? Or hoped that the problem just disappears again? But you have already checked with employees and completed an analyses - so another round will probably not change a lot in the conclusion.

The best choice here is appreciate John's strengths first, to make certain that the discussion is not only about his challenges. This increases the chance that he is not in the defensive position, but is willing to cooperate. 

You could also have started the conversation by letting John explain first, but this could have led to a discussion and making it difficult explain why you have decided to move John. 

Great that you didn't choose to let your HR Partner handle the conversation, since this is not taking responsibility for your decision. 


# Outcome
Since you didn't move John you still experienced a negative effect in output (-3), engagement in the team is also decreasing (-3), but no resources are used (0).
